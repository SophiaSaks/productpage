# Sophias coding test for Ubiquiti

For this test, I put most of my time into writing as clean of a code as possible and making sure the functionality is working well. 

Make sure to do an npm install before running the project, I deleted the node_module folder in order to make the file smaller.

## Functionality

From the Figma-file I could tell that the page needs to be able to toggle between list and grid, a product page should be presented once clicking on a device, and we should also be able to filter the lists with a searchbar and checklist of the product lines. 


## Design choices

I've only made minor changes to the UI, since I found the UI presented in the Figma-file delivered to us was very clean and also in line with Ubiquitis UI. 
My approach to this task was to see it as if a designer-team has already given me a design and that my job is to make sure it's as similar as possible to their idea, with some room for slight adjustments and suggestions.

## UX

I kept the UX in mind while building this page, and made some minor changes, such as adding some background to the list items and trying to place out the text to make the reading as intuitive as possible for the user. Having a big list like this can be overwhelming to navigate, however I think that the filtering and search functions are already simplifying it significantly. 
I made the list/grid button into one button that toggles between them, because I found that it makes it even clearer for the user which view they are in currently and which they can switch to. 


# Continous work

If this would be a project I would hand over to a team of developers and designers, these are the things I would point out that could need some more work.

## Pictures

I discovered that some of the pictures for the devices are blurry, which might be because of the resolution of the pictures that I'm using. 
Due to the timeframe and prioritising the functionality and design in general, I did not investigate this any further, but for a real page it would be of high importance that the pictures are in high resolution and that the sizing of the pictures are making sense.

## Responsiveness

I have only slightly been looking at the responsiveness of the page, first of all since the test itself is for making a desktop view, and if it's for staff I figured it's not as likely that they will use a phone for the page, but probably a monitor in their office. However, I think it's always good to make a page responsive.

# Challenges

## Typescript

Since I have only used typescript briefly before, this was definitely one of the more challenging parts of the test. 
But since it's something I've been wanting to dig deeper into, I'm quite happy that it was a part of the test and to get the chance to practise it on an actual project/test.
